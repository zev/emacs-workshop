These are the presentation files and notes for the 2010 RubyKaigi M-x
emacs-and-ruby workshop.

The goal of the workshop is to get a group of Emacs users together and
show off Ruby coding techniques and other uses of Emacs.

To run the presentation you will need epresent installed.

Then load the file presentation_runner.el.

Once loaded type C-> to go to the next slide.

Note each slide is a set of code that may do things to the buffer.
Some of these slides will load up a epresent slide.  Inside of
epresent press n to go to the next slide inside of epresent.  To go to
the next slide in the "presentation" simply press C-> even inside of
epresent.
