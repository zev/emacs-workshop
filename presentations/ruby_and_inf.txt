* @Ruby mode basics

* Navigation
** [C-down] go to next empty line
** [C-up] go to previous line comint-previous-input
   # This actually jumps the empty lines

**   [C-M-a] beginning of defun
**   [C-M-e] end of defun
** both of these seem to take me to the top of the class versus defs

* Nav2
**   [C-M-f] forward sexp
**   [C-M-b] backward sexp
   # This depends upon where the cursor is

**   [C-M-n] end of block
**   [C-M-p] beginning of block
   # These tend to be a bit more understandable

** [ C-M-h ] mark defun

* Indentation (re indent) etc
**   [C-M-q] indent-exp based on indent level of def


#** next defp
#** [ ] select def
## Beginning of defun has issues from time to time


* Commenting

** Ruby-mode and sending to inf-ruby
   [C-c C-b] send block
   [C-c C-x] [C-M-x] send definition
   # I find that these two methods are unreliable as to what the
   send. it is probably just me, so I want someone else to show me the
   light.

   [C-c C-l] load file
   [C-c C-r] send region
   # These two are reliable
   [C-c C-z] switch to inf mode


** electric mode

** IRB interaction

   #[C-x C-e] send last line of code to ruby process

   [C-c M-r] send region and go


* q
