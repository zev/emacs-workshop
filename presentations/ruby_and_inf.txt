** Quick review of some basic commands.

* Navigation

** [C-down] go to next empty line
** [C-up] go to previous line comint-previous-input
   # This actually jumps the empty lines

** [C-M-a] beginning of defun
** [C-M-e] end of defun
** both of these seem to take me to the top of the class versus defs

* Nav2
** [C-M-f] forward sexp
** [C-M-b] backward sexp
   # This depends upon where the cursor is

** [C-M-n] end of block
** [C-M-p] beginning of block
   # These tend to be a bit more understandable

** [ C-M-h ] mark defun

* Indentation (re indent) etc

** [C-M-q] indent-exp based on indent level of def
** Select whole buffer and indent

#** next defp
#** [ ] select def
## Beginning of defun has issues from time to time

** [C-c C-b] send block

** [C-c C-x] [C-M-x] send definition
